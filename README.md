### Hello there :D

I am a young and passionate software developer. Right now I am working on full-stack applications. NextJS, ReactJS or Angular are some frontend frameworks i currently use. I also worked with backend frameworks like Hibernate, dotNet and I have also built backend services using NodeJS with ExpressJS on top. Last but not least I use SQL for my databases and also tried out some things with Redis. I also like to try out new things and learn something.
